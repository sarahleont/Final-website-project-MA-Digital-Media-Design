Dotty Cow Website project by Sarah Leontovitsch
Dotty Cow Website project aims to build a business to business website for a start-up fashion brand and manufacturing consultancy. The client is setting herself up as a consultant fashion buyer by the name of Dotty Cow. She works with suppliers, manufacturers, and retailers to facilitate the manufacturing process and the fashion supply chain. She can also help develop brands and products. She needs a website to form the centre point of her marketing strategy and give her business some legitimacy.  The website should provide a digital presence and link-up with the client's social media accounts. The project has aimed to design the website according to UX principles; implement the visual identity for the site using the company logo as a starting point; produce visual and written content in collaboration with the client;  and finally, to ensure the website is responsive and accessible.
